# MyScoutee Backend

**The platform behind meetings, not swipes.**

MyScoutee Backend powers group- and event-centred social experiences. It turns
editable 1–10 priorities and mutual affinity into compatible groups, then
supports their journey through chat, events, coordination, and feedback.

Its goal is a **completed, mutually welcomed real-world meeting**—not simply a
match or a message.

## Downloads

### Prerelease installer

A QA prerelease Debian installer, client tools, and their SHA-256 checksum
files are available from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/fssrepository/myscoutee/releases).
These builds are intended for installation and integration testing while the
remaining qualification work is completed.

### Manual QA status and estimate

**2026-09-06:** 88/103 passed; QA infrastructure 2/2, Identity & access 8/8, Tournament 15/15 and Chat 6/6 complete; `ASSET-LIFE-001`, `ASSET-VIS-001`, `ASSET-MEMBER-LIFECYCLE-001`, `ASSET-ASSIGNMENT-LIFECYCLE-001`, `CONTENT-ADMIN-LIFECYCLE-001`, `PAYMENT-METHODS-HISTORY-001` and the Event-owned `EVENT-CHECKOUT-001` journey are PASS/CLOSED; `ASSET-CHECKOUT-001` is staged at its Barion/3DS-Off baseline as the active Asset journey. Deployment is not a Pair-QA domain; Operator work is consolidated into four screen-level journeys, real-device push remains in Notifications, and downstream product behavior stays in its owning domain.

| Remaining phase | Scope | Estimate |
|---|---|---:|
| Pair-QA completion | 15 remaining journeys; current complexity range 1125/2720 minutes | 1–2 Weeks |
| **Cumulative** | **The single remaining Pair-QA queue** | **1–2 Weeks** |
