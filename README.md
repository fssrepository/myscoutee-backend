# MyScoutee Backend

**The platform behind meetings, not swipes.**

MyScoutee Backend powers group- and event-centred social experiences. It turns
editable 1–10 priorities and mutual affinity into compatible groups, then
supports their journey through chat, events, coordination, and feedback.

Its goal is a **completed, mutually welcomed real-world meeting**—not simply a
match or a message.

## Downloads

### Prerelease installer

A QA prerelease Debian installer, client tools, and their SHA-256 checksum
files are available from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/fssrepository/myscoutee/releases).
These builds are intended for installation and integration testing while the
remaining qualification work is completed.

### Manual QA status and estimate

**2026-09-15:** 90/104 passed; QA infrastructure 2/2, Identity & access 8/8, Event 49/49, Tournament 15/15 and Chat 6/6 complete; Notifications 1/6. `UI-POLL-JANK-001` is PASS/CLOSED after user-authorized CDP recordings, two SmartList fixes and session-close attribution; its fixture and managed browsers are cleaned up. `MOBILE-WEBVIEW-LIFECYCLE-001` remains PARTIAL/OPEN: desktop image/session and consent checks are recorded; Help/Guide images, phone resident Settings resume and mobile main-rating photo fit are verified. Physical native install, frontend-local device UI/reload/account transfer, phone consent and Maya session-limit replay now passed; seed progress and larger neutral contact icons were also verified. Non-deferred WebView execution and cleanup are complete; only the tester-deferred clipboard observations remain open. The desktop consent-sequence caveat remains explicit. Deployment is not a Pair-QA domain; Operator work is consolidated into four screen-level journeys; the [Configuration checklist](guides/qa/checklists/operator/OPERATOR-CONFIGURATION-LIFECYCLE-001.md) now maps C01–C08 and shared WebView evidence, with Firebase revision 1 active and the parent still PARTIAL/OPEN; real-device push remains in Notifications, and downstream product behavior stays in its owning domain.

| Remaining phase | Scope | Estimate |
|---|---|---:|
| Pair-QA completion | 14 remaining journeys; current complexity range 870/2105 minutes | 1–2 Weeks |
| **Cumulative** | **The single remaining Pair-QA queue** | **1–2 Weeks** |
